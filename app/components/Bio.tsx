        I&apos;m a software engineer who loves crafting digital experiences with
        JavaScript, Python, and modern web frameworks such as React and Next.js.
        <br />
        When I&apos;m not tinkering with code, you&apos;ll find me exploring new
        technologies and building side projects that solve real-world problems.
        I&apos;m particularly passionate about clean code, performance
        optimization, and creating intuitive user experiences. <br />
        My experience spans building and optimizing full-stack applications,
        implementing RESTful APIs, and working with CI/CD pipelines, as well AWS
        services and cloud-native architectures, all while maintaining a
        customer-centric approach.
        <br />I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with
        designers, product managers, and other engineers to create impactful
        solutions.
