      I&apos;m a software engineer driven by creating exceptional digital
      experiences. With a strong foundation in both technology and business
      operations, I excel at bridging the gap between innovative ideas and
      practical solutions. <br />
      My background as a coffee roaster operation lead instilled in me a deep
      appreciation for efficiency and alignment with strategic goals. This
      unique perspective allows me to quickly grasp project requirements and
      deliver impactful results.
      <br />
      In my free time i love to read, play music or going on a roadtrip.
      Currently reading Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.
